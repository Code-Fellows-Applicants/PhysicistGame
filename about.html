            <h2>Hi! My name is Yoni, welcome to my game for nerds!</h2>
            <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington,
                and I studied BioPhysics for my undergraduate BS.
                In my 4 years I learned about many significant physicists,
                at times diving head first into system and methods that they
                produced themselves. I studied classical mechanics, quantum
                mechanics, particle physics, fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, 
                thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and many more. In addition to the 
                physics, I studied microbiology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, 
                anatomy, and many other disciplines that showed me 
                other applications for these physical laws. These physicists 
                were everywhere in my scientific learnings, but I could never seem to 
                match the face to the name. So I made this game to help me remember
                their faces.
                Although I have learned about many distinct fields of science,
                my education was limited in the scope of Computer Science and 
                Big data analytics, although we touched on some methods in my lab
                classes. That is why I hope to join code fellows and learn about
                CS, data analysis, and using computers to simplify problems using
                logic.
