            <p> My name is Yoni, I recently graduated from UW,
                where I studied BioPhysics.
                In my 4 years I learned about many significant physicists,
                at times diving head first into system and methods that they
                produced themselves. I studied classical mechanics, quantum
                mechanics, particle physics, fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, 
                thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and others. These physicists 
                were everywhere in my scientific learnings, but I could never seem to 
                match the face to the name. So I made this game to help me remember
                their faces.
